Review on lambdata.

I really like how you set up your docstring.  It is very helpful for someone who might use your package.
I like how it shows the parameter requirements and example usage. 

Question:
When you commented out parts that I think was intended to be docstring, can we just do the '#', or should we enclosed it in """    """?
I mean if it's intended to be docstring, shouldn't it be inside the triple quotes? I can see that they are in your README file though.
